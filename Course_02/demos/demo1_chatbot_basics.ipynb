This allows words to be represented numerically, making it easier for machine learning algorithms to process and analyze textual data. Embeddings capture semantic and syntactic relationships between words, enabling algorithms to understand the context and meaning of words in a given text. Popular embedding techniques include Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText.\n"

    "## 🎯 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **LLMs predict the next word** - that's the fundamental operation, but it enables complex behaviors\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Conversation requires state** - you must include message history in each API call\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **System prompts are powerful** - they shape behavior without the user seeing them\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Structure matters** - messages have roles (system, user, assistant) that guide the model\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💰 Cost Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Each API call costs money based on tokens:\n",
    "- System prompt: counted every time\n",
    "- Conversation history: grows with each turn\n",
    "- New message: adds more tokens\n",
    "- Response: output tokens cost more!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro tip**: Long conversations get expensive. Consider truncating old history in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Try these experiments:\n",
    "1. Change the temperature (0 = deterministic, 1+ = creative)\n",
    "2. Modify the system prompt to create different personalities\n",
    "3. Add intent classification before generating responses\n",
    "4. Implement conversation summarization for long chats\n",
